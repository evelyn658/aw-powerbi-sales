## Recommendations: 
Based on the insights uncovered, the following recommendations are provided:
- With accessories accounting for 65.17% of orders (e.g., 30 oz. Water Bottle at 53%) but only 6.18% of revenue, **run targeted campaigns for popular low-cost, high-frequency items** like water bottles and helmets.

- Introduce **bundle promotions during seasonal peaks** (e.g., June: +68% YoY, December: holiday spike) by pairing accessories with bikes (e.g., Mountain Bike Model 200 Black, 17.5% of revenue) to boost AOV and cross-sell.

- **Personalize offers for the 35‚Äì54 age group** (54.9% of revenue, 51.7% of orders), focusing on North America (92.7% bike sales) and customers in professional roles (AOV > $500).

- Develop **entry-level offers for high-volume customers** (60‚Äì68 orders/year, $70K‚Äì$80K income, mostly married), then upsell to bikes through lifecycle promotions.
